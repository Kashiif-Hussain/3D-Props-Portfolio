# 🧱 3D Props Portfolio

Welcome to my **3D Props Portfolio** — a curated collection of my 3D models and assets created in **Blender**.  
This repository showcases my modeling, texturing, and rendering skills as part of my creative and technical journey in 3D art.

## 🧩 About the Project

Each folder in this repository represents a **unique prop** — designed, modeled, and textured by me.  
These assets highlight my attention to **detail, realism, topology optimization, and clean UV mapping**.

> 🖼️ Examples include: furniture, tools, environmental props, and more — suitable for games, visualization, and animation projects.
